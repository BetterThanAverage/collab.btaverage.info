        <p>
          BTA Collab is a new initiative by the organizers of the Better Than
          Average (BTA) Celeste Tournament.

        <h2>Intentions & Motivation</h2>
        <p class="importantbody">
          We want to create a collab that celebrates speedrunning and show off
          levels that are made with speedrunning in mind. Levels that are
          difficult to optimize, test mechanic knowledge and game knowledge, and
          keep runners at the edge of their seat, which should make them MOST
          IMPORTANTLY... fun to speedrun. Our hope is that the BTA Collab will
          be a true test of player's speedrunning chops.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="importantbody">
          It's our hope BTA Collab will also be used for the finals of the coming year of BTA
          competitions, and because competitors will have a limited amount of
          time with the levels before they need to use them in a competition, we
          aim to test strat formulation in a way we haven't been able to before.
        </p>
        <h3>Completion looks like:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>24 maps + a Heartside map, to parallel vanilla Celeste</li>
          <li>A lobby to house all 25 maps</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>
          Most of our timeline is pretty flexible and still in the works, but
          here's what we're thinking at the moment:

        <h2>Mapping Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          The goal is to bring together levels that embody the spirit of vanilla
          speedrunning, but with new levels and a little chocolate.
        </p>

        <p>Try to stay within these guidelines:</p>
        <ul class="otherlist">
          <li>
            Don't make it too difficult to finish! We don't have a hard limit to
            difficulty but please keep it beginner, intermediate, or mayyybe low
            advanced.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maps may not require tech outside of what's taught in the beginner
            and intermediate gyms in Strawberry Jam. If you do make a room that
            requires anything harder or more obscure, you should also create an
            alternative route of about the same length that doesn't require it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid engineering shortcuts. Let the process of creative strat
            choice take place for runners.
          </li>
          <li>No RNG (or similarly unpredictable mechanics)</li>
          <li>
            Custom mechanics/entities are allowed and encouraged, but try to
            avoid using anything too chocolatey or obscure. We want to encourage
            strat discovery, not to knowledge-check the players!
          </li>
          <li>
            Aim for over 2 minutes Speedrun time of maps; the longer the better
            (within reason). This does mean all maps should be a bit on the long
            side.
          </li>
        </ul>
